Started When just wanted to play this awsom board game, but didn't want to be dependant on the second player to make up of a a secret code, and for feedback.
and then i relize. 'Now that I am a second year computer science and cognitive science student (at the time of 2019), I can implement an automation for that second player, pretty monotonic job, clssic for utilizing my oop patterns skills, and my first time to desighn a game and  asoftware architect from scratch, all by my own.

# How to run the code
download the files, save at one repository. Run the file 'Game.py'. this is the main file that runs the program.

# How to play the game
there is a secret code of four distinct digits (out of 01234567). you need to guess the digits and the sequence. 
each time you guess a code, you get a feedback, contains 4 digits (out of 012)
number of 2's means how many digits out of your guess code you guessed excatly.
number of 1's means how many digits out of your guess code you guessed the digits right, but not the location.
number of 0's means how many digits out of your guess code you guessed wrong - not apears at all at the secret code.
